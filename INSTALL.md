## Install required tools

Tomb needs a few programs to be installed on a system in order to work:

 * zsh
 * gnupg
 * cryptsetup
 * pinentry-curses (or -gtk or -qt as you prefer)

Most systems provide these tools in their package collection,
for instance on Debian/Ubuntu one can use 'apt-get install'
on Fedora and CentOS one can use 'yum install'

## Install Tomb

To install Tomb simply download the source distribution (the tar.gz file)
and decompress it. From a terminal:

    cd Downloads
    tar xvfz Tomb-1.5.3.tar.gz (correct with actual file name)

Then enter its directory and run 'make install' as root, this will install
Tomb into /usr/local:

    cd Tomb-1.5.3 (correct with actual directory name)
    sudo make install

After installation one can read the commandline help or read the manual:

    tomb -h     (print a short help on the commandline)
    man tomb    (show the full usage manual)

At this point one can proceed creating a tomb, for instance:

    tomb dig -s 1000 secrets.tomb       (be patient and wait a bit)
    tomb forge -k secrets.tomb.key     (be patient and follow instructions)
    tomb lock  -k secrets.tomb.key secrets.tomb
